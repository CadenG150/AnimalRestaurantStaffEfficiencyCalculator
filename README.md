# Animal RestaurantStaff Efficiency Calculator
Upgrading your staff in the Animal Restaurant game gives you stars and can be just as good as facilities, especially early game, for farming stars. This code lets you input your restaurant staff data and calculates the most efficient way to upgrade your staff for maximum star gain.
## How To Use
Clone the repository
```git clone https://github.com/CadenG150/AnimalRestaurantStaffEfficiencyCalculator.git```
Open the folder in your terminal and run
```python main.py```
You will be met with three options
## Option 1 - Edit Data
This option will only work if you already have data created, there is sample data included in this repository.  **Make sure you run Option 2 first in order to make the program use your own data.**
After selecting Option 1 you will be met with the data for all of your staff, type in a number to select a staff member and then type in another number for the new value of how much it costs to ugprade the staff you selected.
## Option 2 - Create Data
This is the option you should run on startup, it will prompt you to input how much each staff member **costs** to upgrade and from that it will be all ready to perform Option 3
## Option 3 - Calculate
This option takes the data you have created and calculates the Cod Per Star upgrading each staff member would cost you.  Obviously spending less cod per star is better, so the first option is the most efficient staff to upgrade.
